# attinyLED
ws2812B I2C driver using attiny85

The tiny85 is now an I2C slave that can drive a string of ws2812B leds

There are two builds - Palette and non-Palette

The latter will let you control ~90 LEDs, and set RGB for each one, while the former allows you to address 300 of 
them using a pre-defined palette (basically the web pallete) - i'll add a user-defineable palette soon
